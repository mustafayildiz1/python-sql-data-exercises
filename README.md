# Python & SQL Data Exercises 📊

This project contains small exercises I completed while learning the basics 
of working with data using **Python (Pandas)** and **SQL**.

It is not a full data analysis project — the goal is simply to show 
basic skills such as:

- Reading and cleaning a CSV file  
- Simple aggregations (revenue, top products, totals)  
- Grouping and sorting operations  
- Writing beginner SQL queries  
- Using a Jupyter notebook to walk through the analysis  

The dataset is a small, fictional sales dataset created for practice.
